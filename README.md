# Reverse engineer tools and custom server for emo by living.ai

This repository is to collect and document my tools and knowledge of the emo desktop robot pet by living.ai.
Far goal is to have a toolset to make a standalone server to replace the living.ai server to gain privacy, flexibility to customize and to be independent.

First tool is a proxy to monitor the api calls between emo and the server.

### **This repository is *not* assosiated with living.ai**

I am only a private developer who have adopted one of the emo's.
